# AMEngine

This is an incredibly work in progress 3D game engine.

The ultimate end goal is to create a 3D game engine inspired heavily by the Source Engine, but is fully open source and HOPEFULLY a lot simpler and easier to use.

The code used should be mostly cross platform friendly, and so their shouldn't be any reason you couldn't set this up to work on say Linux. I still need to learn CMake :/

This engine will not be supporting 32 bit systems.

Project uses C++17.

IMPORTANT: Please review the licenses of thirdparty libraries and code in their respective folders under the "source/thirdparty" folder.
